        <p>Michael Scofield is a desperate man in a desperate situation. His brother, Lincoln Burrows,
            was convicted of a crime he didn't commit and put on Death Row. Michael holds up a bank to get
            himself incarcerated alongside his brother in Fox River State Penitentiary, then sets in motion
            a series of elaborate plans to break Lincoln out and prove his innocence. Once out of jail,
            their perils aren't over -- the brothers must flee to escape recapture and battle an intricate
            political conspiracy that puts everyone's life at risk.</p>
